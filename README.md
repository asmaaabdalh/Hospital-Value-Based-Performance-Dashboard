# Hospital-Value-Based-Performance-Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital performance using a value-based care approach, aiming to balance quality of care with financial outcomes. The dashboard provides decision-makers with clear, data-driven insights into patient satisfaction, complications, readmissions, and spending efficiency.

The analysis was conducted on a large-scale healthcare dataset, and this dashboard represents a focused segment of the overall project. The work was completed end-to-end, starting from raw data and concluding with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

🎯 Project Objectives

Evaluate hospital performance from both clinical quality and financial perspectives

Identify patterns and trends in patient satisfaction and readmission rates

Compare hospital spending against national benchmarks

Highlight top and bottom performance measures to support improvement initiatives

Enable stakeholders to explore insights through interactive visualizations

🧩 Scope of Work

The project was handled comprehensively and included:

Working with large and complex datasets
